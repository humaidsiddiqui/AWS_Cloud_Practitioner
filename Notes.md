a little bit of IT terminology before we get started, the network is a bunch of cables, routers, and servers that are going to be connected with each other, and the router is a specific device that will forward the data packets between computer in the networks, and they will know where to send your packets on the internet,

just like your post delivery service. Now when we have a packet and it arrives as a destination, there's a switch, and the switch will send the packet to the correct clients on your network.

So if we put all these things together, it looks like this. Our client will send the data to a router, the router will find it's way all the way to a switch, and the switch will know to which computer in your network to send the data to.
